        <p>Hello, I'm Zion Wu. I was born in the West Ashley neighborhood of Charleston, SC, and raised in various cities including San Francisco and Oakland, Atlanta,<br>
           Memphis, Chester, Queens, Seattle, Jacksonville, and Baton Rouge. Each of these places has played a significant role in shaping who I am today. <br>
        I’m passionate about music, dance, martial arts, and constantly learning new things. My journey began with a deep interest in movies, music videos, <br>
        and fight clips on the internet and DVDs. My grandfather inspired me to explore different dance and martial arts styles such as popping and breakdancing. <br>
        This website is a reflection of my experiences, skills, and the community I've built over time, and I hope you enjoy the content I share. <br>
        As for my family heritage, I come from a rich and diverse background. On my maternal side, I have Nigerian, Chinese, Polish, Japanese, and Native American <br>
         roots, while my paternal side brings Jamaican and Colombian heritage. I embrace and celebrate my unique background, which has greatly influenced who I am today.</p>
        Feel free to check out my store and support the work I do—your support means the world to me!</p>
